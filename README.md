# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
 This is a application for user to add their tasks during the business hours

 First we created an html and added a conatainer and then another container with class and added times in the slots. Repeated same code for all 9 business hours. Used the given bootstrap and named classes in html accordingly.

 Created a javascript file first created a variable with current time and added to the to webpage. Then created a for loop that will run until we run out of busniess hours, in that for loop added if and else statments to validate the current time with the busniess hour and adding classes with colors inside css to represent past present and future.
Making a event listener that will run when window is loaded added a event listener to a buttons and save text of the textarea into a variable. Then saving that into localstorage and displaying them by using .getItem.
